Usually, the end of a semester feels like a bit the calm after a storm. I’m able to look back and
scoff at my folly and say that I learnt a lot and that this semester changed me, yada yada and then
publish a sober blog post feeling very good about myself indeed. I didn’t feel that way this time. I
feel like I am still feeling the aftermath of a rude awakening. I made some long term decisions I
never though I would. I think during parts of it, I was brave. (Typing this out loud feels weird,
but you know what? I’ve made my peace with it. I’m allowed to be weird here. I *was* brave.)

So I will let the spring semester digest for a little bit.

Oh well. Now that I’ve shrugged off the imaginary responsibility of recapitulating the spring
semester, I’m going to move on to the easy stuff. September!

### Moving

On the first of September, I moved. It involved packing up my stuff after living
in an apartment for a year, disassembling all my furniture (yes I own all the
furniture I use and I handpicked it and this was not the wisest choice since I
move frequently, but you know? Whatever.), loading it up in a U-Haul, moving it
up two flights of stairs, and assembling it all back together in the short span
of twelve hours.

I am a changed person. This body was not built for lifting
anything heavier than a jumbo pack of paper towels, let me tell you.

I hereby assign Friends seasons 1-10 as homework to *everyone* so that I am never left laughing alone as I try to
haul a white sofa up a narrow staircase, yelling “PIVOT.”

This taught me mostly that I own a **lot** of stuff. I wish I could say I sincerely regret buying that
wretched turquoise teapot, four boxes of books and that hideous plant. I don’t.

### Texas
A day later, I bid a very disgruntled goodbye to Waterloo and flew to Dallas first, to visit my
family. We ate good food and visited [Fossil Rim](http://www.fossilrim.org/).

On Labor Day, we drove to Austin, which to my intense dismay, turned out to be the least Texan
city I’ve been to. There went my quintessential Texan experience. Things I like about Austin so far

- My apartment. Very much like Celaena Sardothien’s apartment in Rifthold in that it feels like a
**sanctuary** and very much my own. Having my own washer/dryer unit for the first time in two+ years is
basically one of the highlights of my year.
- The people.
- The portion sizes.
- How there's live music in almost every part of downtown Austin.

### Book Events

So apparently, Austin is interesting enough to merit a visit from some of my
**all time favourite** YA authors. Tahereh Mafi, Ransom Riggs, and Sarah J. Maas
all stopped in Austin for their book tours for Furthermore, Tales of the
Peculiar and Empire of Storms (respectively).

To say that I soundly lost my shit is the understatement of my life.

Embarrassing highlight of the Sarah J Maas signing: When she asked the audience
if we’d read The Hating Game and I screeched out “MEEEE” and the whole
crowd fell silent and they all stared at me. Apparently it isn't as well known
as I thought it was. In my defense, I didn’t **mean** to screech. But then Sarah
cackled her signature witch cackle and everything was okay. She offered to personalize a
second book for me (she was only supposed to do one) since I asked her to sign Empire of Storms for my sister.

Also Tahereh Mafi told me she liked my

### Work

I like how I am very much responsible for my own progress at work. I started my
last internship burdened, I guess, by my own expectations and the expectations
that the people at work laid out for me. The work I’m doing here is better
(technically), and the people are better, and I very much feel like this is an
environment in which I can learn. I have the space to experiment and grow to love what I do. I am constantly told I ask very good
questions, which is a big relief because I was lowkey worried I was asking too
many. But instead, I am being told that my questions are not only welcome, but
also valid.

I forgot to mention that one line also broke prod for a whole hour.
