If you’re a student at Waterloo, you know what’s up. I am writing for two
reasons. First, I want to take a public position on this issue, and explain why
I am voting the way I am. Secondly, I want to stress the importance of making an
informed, thoughtful decision guided by facts---not words that are meant to whip
people up in a frenzy and everybody’s voting, but nobody actually knows *why*
they’re voting the way they are. I guess I’m asking whoever reads this to ask
themselves how informed they really are. You might think that this referendum is
simply about the existence of one organization, but it is much more than that. It
is about the people we want to be and the values we want to uphold at Waterloo.

**As a former member and chair of WiCS undergraduate, this is why I support WPIRG.**

WiCS undergraduate branched off from the faculty “big” WiCS committee with the
aim of “maintaining its ideological independence”, according to its founder. Now, we primarily receive
funding from MathSoc (for events that are open to all students), and the faculty
committee “big” WiCS (for our Big CSters events).

Suppose WiCS undergraduate wanted to run a women-only computer science workshop
for non-CS majors. Big WiCS would not fund us since we are not directly
benefitting the students of SCS. MathSoc would not fund us because it is a
women-only event. BlackBerry or Google might fund us, but not without asking us
to display their logo, promote their brand, and essentially affiliate ourselves
with them.

Suppose we wanted to run an event openly discussing the current interview
process and its flaws. $big_tech_company would certainly not fund us, as
creators of that process. Big WiCS would probably not fund us, since the faculty
often works with and supports those companies. If we chose to make the event
women-only, MathSoc would not fund us either.

These are examples of events that promote our
[values](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/constitution/) of technical excellence,
accountability and inclusivity, for which is it not as easy to secure funding.
In these situations, WPIRG would fund us. They are our only independent source
of funding. It is through them that we are able to provide our services,
independent of the agendas of external groups. It is the only organization that
I have seen to fully and wholeheartedly support our cause, over the past year
that I have been involved with the committee.

**As a student at Waterloo, this is why I support WPIRG.**

It is an an organization that protests the hike of international tuition, runs
feminism-for-men events, assists students that have been misled by landlords
(most recently, ICON), funds [the Aboriginal Students Association](https://uwaterloo.ca/stpauls/waterloo-aboriginal-education-centre/our-staff/aboriginal-student-association), the [Muslim
Students Association](http://uwmsa.com/), [UW Students For Justice In Pakistan](https://www.facebook.com/groups/283691575020746/), [UW Black Association for Student Expression](https://www.facebook.com/uwbase), to name [only a few](http://wpirg.org/about/). These are
groups serving to protect the rights, the voices, the interests of severely
underrepresented and marginalized communities in our societies that receive support and funding
from WPIRG, free of any conditions and stipulations. It baffles me that the Opt
In movement calls any of this replaceable or redundant.

If WPIRG loses this vote, there will be no any way to make the fee “opt in” on
Quest. The organization will be defunded, and these organizations, many of whom
are primarily funded by WPIRG will not exist the way they did before.

*This entire campaign has left a bad taste in my mouth, more because of the
ugliness and abuse that gave birth to it than anything else.* I know perfectly
well meaning and friendly people that support Opt-In, but I am vastly
uncomfortable with the people who are the faces of this campaign. Their
engagement with people who do not align themselves with them is rude and
borderline abusive. This movement was born out of a hate campaign towards a
student who had their facebook comments plastered on the [front page of the
school newspaper](http://imgur.com/nhoLV6q) and [still continues to receive
online
abuse](https://www.facebook.com/Darshwanda/posts/925223584289428?pnref=story)
for a mistake that they have repeatedly
[apologized](https://www.facebook.com/notes/deanna-darby-barton/an-open-letter-to-the-undergraduates-of-uwaterloo/803886553089799)
for. 

These are not people I would like as my leaders. These are not the people I want
representing me.

WPIRG is *not* a perfect organization, devoid of their problems. But the
question here isn’t if WPIRG is flawed. The question is if we think if those flaws merit a complete dissolution of this organization---stance
that is absurd and extremist.

Some students might feel like they don’t have a strong enough opinion and decide
to abstain from voting. Some organizations might decide that they are going to
remain politically neutral, aiming to refrain from hurting or helping either
side. There might be those who think that as students who don’t directly benefit
from WPIRG, they shouldn’t be asked to pay a fee. Even worse, there might be
many students who are painfully misinformed, consuming only the content that the
fine [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo) of my university churns out
on an hourly basis, or the paltry four illogical
[points](https://www.facebook.com/optinuw/photos/a.179245889107454.1073741828.177822142583162/212671702431539/?type=3)
on which this entire campaign has been erected.

But passiveness in this situation is actively harmful. When we refuse to speak,
we are giving a voice to those that want to dissolve an organization that exists
to protect the underprivileged. When we do not educate ourselves and rely on
those that scream “student independence”, “social justice warriors”, “control
where your dollars go”, and “politically radical”, we risk casting votes that
mean nothing, votes that were never ours to begin with.

We cannot afford to give power to a group that trivializes the the significance of an organization like WPIRG. We cannot afford to be bystanders. We cannot afford to be
ignorant.
