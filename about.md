I study computer science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/){:target="_blank"}, in Waterloo, Canada. It's quite cold here. Here are some things that are important to me.

### Education and Technology

Both technology and the current education systems have a long way to go before they become a safe and inclusive place for all. One of my goals in life is to develop educational tools that recognize the diversity in race, gender, ability, socio-economic status, and literacy in our societies and allow people with a variety of backgrounds and experiences to learn. I am presently an active member of the [Waterloo Women in Computer Science Undergraduate Committee](http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/){:target="_blank"}.

### Reading and writing.

Reading and writing is a huge part of my life. I "wrote" my first book when I was nine and got carried away by an english homework assignment. For most of my middle school life, I tried---and failed---to break the school library's one-book-per-week policy. I write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@arshia__){:target="_blank"}, occasionally [LiveJournal](http://arshia-mufti.livejournal.com/){:target="_blank"}, and review books for [Maji Bookshelf](http://majibookshelf.blogspot.ca/){:target="_blank"}. Some of my favourite authors are Frances H. Burnett, L. M. Montgomery, Enid Blyton, Melina Marchetta, Megan McAfferty, Markus Zusak, and J. K. Rowling.

This is where I was born. My family moved away when I was very young. I miss it everyday.

I also actively maintain a list of tech/non-tech things I want to accomplish in the next few months, serif fonts I like, and coffee shops around Kitchener-Waterloo I'd like to try out.
